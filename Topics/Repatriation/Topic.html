      <p style="text-align:left"><a class = "abouttext">Repatriation is the return of goods, or objects from an organization or country to another country.  Repatriation does not involve the return of goods to a singular person.  The UNESCO laws of 1970 and 1972 set forth the definitions of cultural objects and the practices that signing countries must take when buying goods.  The possible return of objects has arguments from both sides about whether objects bought before this date should be returned or not.  Many museums refuse to return objects, saying that they are part of world heritage and are used for the education of millions of people.  Countries, or organizations that ask for objects back usually argue that goods were taken illegally and that objects are not of world heritage but of the heritage of that country and should be given back to its people. </a>
