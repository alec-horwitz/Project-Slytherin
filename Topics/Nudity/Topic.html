      <p style="text-align:left"><a class = "abouttext">Censorship in general, the practice of suppressing certain works of art on the basis of obscenity or because of a work's controversial nature, has been a practice for nearly as long as human history. Book, film, television, painting and performances have all been censored over the years. A common reason for censorship of art is nudity, the argument being made that such works featuring overt nudity ought to be censored because they are either inappropriate, obscene or challenge contemporary views of accepted sexuality. Censorship is a direct assault on the First Amendment and the Freedom of Speech, however the landmark Supreme Court Case, Miller v. California, determined that "obscenity" is not protected under the Constitution of the United States. Particularly in censorship cases relating to nudity or other taboo subjects determining what is and what is not obscene can be very challenging because there is no official, legal definition of obscenity in the United States.</a>
