UPDATED By Alec: 3/17/2017 -- 1:10 am

I updated the webpages with a scroll down menu bar and gave them a consistent theme with the exception of the bio pages as 
they are to be merged with the landing page's(now called index.html per standard convention) code. 
Student Bios are still not connected yet.

The individual studentTemp.html files have been named after their old parent folder names and moved to a 
folder called "Topics" and they all now use a unified .css file caled TopicStyle.css.  

Note that the menu for index.html is different from the topic menu bars. This is to achive asthetic consistency throughout 
the site by always offering binary options.

A new folder called "Bios" has been added for all the bios that will be made in the coming months.

All unused/excess files have been removed.


UPDATED By Muneeba: 3/3/2017 -- 12:20 am

I updated the webpages and connected them together. 
Student Bios are not connected yet. 
Each individual project has been named and has a unique "Article" and "Project" component.
