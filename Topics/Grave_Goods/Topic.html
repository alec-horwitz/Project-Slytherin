      <p style="text-align:left"><a class = "abouttext">Grave goods - funerary objects that have been deposited into burial or grave sites - have been removed, looted, or stolen from their intended final resting places for centuries, thus, it is no surprise that the removal of grave goods persists to this day. Looters and archaeologists are argued by some to be "strip mining our past," disturbing a culture's intentions for an object's intrinsic connection to the deceased. Conversely, some argue that transferring grave goods from burial grounds and into museums, private, and public collections allows visitors to engage with and learn from objects that otherwise would have been destroyed by political and economic instability. Looting, unfortunately, will continue as long as host countries view grave goods as luxurious and precious objects rather than important and necessary vehicles in the story of "our past". It is essential to remember, however, that grave goods are deposited in graves for a reason, and the ritual and process of burying the deceased varies cross culturally; objects in graves will thus have varying meaning and significance across the world. </a>
