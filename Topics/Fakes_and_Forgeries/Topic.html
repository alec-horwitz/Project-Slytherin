      <p style="text-align:left"><a class = "abouttext">Fakes and forgeries are among the most psychologically interesting and well-known controversies found in the art world. The difference between the terms lies in their creation: a forgery is a replica created for profit while a fake is something that has been modified to increase value. Forgeries may be relatively easier to create while a fake involves obtaining an authentic piece of work to modify. Both are often tied to other types of art-related crime like theft or fraud - police often cannot arrest forgers on the charge of "forgery," but instead fraud. The media generally portrays forgers as worthy of praise due to their artistic skills, even when they have used those skills disreputably (Charney, 107). The practice of creating and selling forgeries has been around for millennia, beginning with the Romans; and today, the discovery of a forged work prompts many questions including: whether forgers should be recognized as artists; the authenticity of other pieces inside a museum collection after the discovery of a fake or forgery; and lastly, what drives a person to become a forger. </a>
