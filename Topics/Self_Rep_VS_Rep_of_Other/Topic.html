      <p style="text-align:left"><a class = "abouttext">Museums have a history of misrepresenting the "Other." This misrepresentation stems from the institutions' ties to colonialism. Objects from the different countries were collected, and kept as specimens to study with little understanding of its' original meaning or intended use. This cultural theft continues into the present, and manifests itself in fashion, art, and media, which we consume. Now that the dialogue surrounding race, and culture are becoming more commonplace. Museums are becoming more aware of the voices, and the narratives that it presents to educate the public, rather than perpetuating prejudices. In my project I will take a look at how museums have tried to navigate how to represent non-western culture in an appropriate manner, and the different roles the cultural groups, and local communities take in the process. </p></a>
