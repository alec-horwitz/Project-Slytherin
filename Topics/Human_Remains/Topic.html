      <p style="text-align:left"><a class = "abouttext">Displaying or conserving human remains in museum collections can be controversial because they were once human and contain human emotions. Human remains were not meant to be collected or displayed. Therefore, digging them out and is disrespectful and it might violates the ancestral beliefs and offends their descendants. Also, displaying human remains is contradictory to some religious beliefs. However, human remains usually have educational values as they provide us knowledges about our past. Thus, collecting human remains is controversial in cultural, ethical and religious aspects.</a>
